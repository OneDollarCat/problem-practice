Project-euler is a great place where you can try and solve many problems!
It doesn't ask for any code, just you have to submit your answer for a pre-defined and single test case.
The problems, however, do expect you to solve them using programming and problem-solving, though they are quite math-heavy.
Here, I'll be posting my code solutions to different problems I solve, and a few of them may be able to work for any test case.
If you want to try out the problems yourself, you can get them at projecteuler.net.
It's completely free!
So, get in here, see my solutions, and get out there, and start solving on your own!
