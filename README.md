# problem-practice
Hey, there! 👋
## Who am I?
This is **OneDollarCat**, or you can also call me **OneDollarCode**.
## What is this repo?
This repo is called **problem-practice**, where I post my *code solutions to online problems*.
## How do I run the code? What language do you use anyway?
I am a proud **C++** coder, I learn it for **Competitive Programming (CP)**, which we'll get to soon, I may also use other languages such as **C**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, but that would be quite rare.
Here's a *hello world* program written in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
     cout << "Hello, world!";
     return 0;
}
```
Ok, and to run my code, copy and paste it to an IDE which can compile code in C++, or you can:
- Copy and paste the code into a *C++ file* (.cpp).
- Compile it using *any compiler*:
  
Using g++:
``` bash
g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
./fileName
```
Using clang:
``` bash
clang fileName.cpp -o fileName
./fileName
```
