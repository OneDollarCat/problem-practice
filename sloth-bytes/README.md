üëã Hey there, it's me, **OneDollarCat**! üò∫
## ‚ùì What is this?
This is a directory of my problem-practice repo called **sloth-bytes**.
## ‚ùì What is this for? And what even is Sloth Bytes?
Well, there's a YouTuber called [The Coding Sloth](www.youtube.com/@TheCodingSloth) whose channel is based on programming, and he's also really funny, go check out his videos!  
Ok, back to the topic:  
He also has a great newsletter called [Sloth Bytes](slothbytes.beehiiv.com), where he gives **weekly *bite-sized* info** and advice to make *you* a better programmer!  
And at the end of each mail, there's a **Weekly Challenge** section where he gives a problem to solve by making a *function*.  
And this is where I push *my solutions* to his problems.
## üóÉ What's inside?
In this directory, there are sub-directories for each problem.
Each of these sub-directories contains:
1. A `.md` file containing the **problem statement**.
2. A `.md` file with my **analysis and implementation** of the problem.
3. A further sub-directory `code` containing:
  - The **function source file** (written in **C++**, therefore a `.cpp` file)
  - The **tests file**, which calls the function (also a `.cpp` file)
  - The **header file** to link both the source and the main files (It's also written in C++, but commonly has a `.h` or a `.hpp` extension, I use the `.hpp` extension, but note that it doesn't matter anyway.)
## ‚öí How to use:
### 1. üìÇ Clone the repo
If you haven't already, **clone this repo** using this command:
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/OneDollarCat/problem-practice.git
```
### 2. üìç Navigate to the problem sub-directory
To enter the sub-directory of a problem, say `problem1`, use this command:
```Bash
cd problem-practice/sloth-bytes/problem1
```
### 3. Enter the code sub-directory
For this:
``` Bash
cd code
```
### 4.  
Ok, that's all for now, `</OneDollarCat>`
