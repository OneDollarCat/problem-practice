## ‚ùì What is this?
This is a **directory** for the *rest* of my problem solutions that are *not* from **Project Euler** or **Sloth Bytes**.
## ü§î How do I access them?
Just **clone** this repo and enter this directory.
Besides this file, there will be `.zip` files, each containing a **C++** .cpp (or  **JavaScript** `.js` / **Java** `.java` (*rarely*)) file, which is the *solution file*, and a **text** `.md /.txt` file, which is the *problem statement*. **Unzip** these `.zip` files and now you can access the files! If you want, you can also compile the solution files, but I won't be showing how, I'm too lazy!
